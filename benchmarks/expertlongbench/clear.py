"""CLEAR -- a reimplementation of ExpertLongBench's checklist-based scorer.

Grounded in arXiv:2506.01241v1 section 4 and appendix C. Read ``NOTES.md`` before changing
anything here; every design decision below cites the section it comes from, and the
authors released no reference implementation to diff against.

The pipeline, per model output:

1. **map** -- one model call extracts, for each rubric item, what the output says about it,
   returning ``"N/A"`` where the output says nothing (S-3.2, S-4.1);
2. **judge** -- two binary containment calls per item, in both directions (S-C.2);
3. **score** -- precision, recall, accuracy and F1 over the *full* checklist (S-4.1).

The arithmetic in :func:`score_sample` is deliberately free of model calls so it can be
unit-tested against hand-built cases.
