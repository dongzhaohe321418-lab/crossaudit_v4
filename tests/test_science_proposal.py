"""The science inference is a proposal with its grounds (SPEC 3 §3.5).

The walkthrough's harm was a laboratory contract arriving unasked and surfacing
later as a BLOCKER about `metadata.yml` — the point at which the audit stopped
reading as a second opinion and started reading as obstruction. Batch 2 removed
that by always defaulting to the general pack, which is right for a prose review
and silently wrong for real science: the rules get drafted from the person's own
description, and the machine checks that would verify those very rules never run.

So the inference is made and shown, with reasons the person can read and refuse.

Every test here executes the real code. The pure inference is exercised
directly; the screen and the wiring through to `crossaudit.yml` are exercised by
running the real `crossaudit init` on a real pty. The only substitution anywhere
is the network transport, which becomes the `replay` provider that already ships
for this purpose — `constitution.distil`, `parse_json_reply`, `Draft.from_json`,
`infer_check_pack` and every wizard screen all execute for real.
