#: Every environment variable that can hand a test a usable provider key.
#: `app_keys.write()` legitimately exports a key into `os.environ` for the app's
#: own core process; a test that exercises it therefore leaks a key into the
#: rest of the SESSION, and every later `create_project` then took the live
#: provider path (`can_draft` is `bool(os.environ[key_env])`). On a developer's
#: machine that call leaves through a local proxy and comes back a 401, which
#: `create_project` swallows as "draft unavailable" — so it passed here and
#: failed on CI, where the socket is direct and the network guard sees it.
#: Scrubbing these per test makes the starting environment the same everywhere,
#: and — because `monkeypatch.setenv` records "was not set" — also undoes a key
#: a test exports directly.

    """Sandboxes the keys FILE and blocks IN-PROCESS outbound sockets.

    The old name was `_no_credentials_and_no_outbound_network`, which asserted a
    property this suite does not have. It was read as "the suite is hermetic" —
    by the engineering manager, in writing — and the name is what everything
    downstream reads. A narrower guard honestly named is worth more than a broad
    one that is wrong.

    WHAT IS COVERED
      * `CROSSAUDIT_KEYS_FILE` is moved to a temp path. `wizard.keys_file()`
        resolves `DEFAULT_KEYS_FILE` from the real home at import, so setting
        `HOME` does not move it; exactly one test file was sandboxing it and
        every other test could load the developer's real keys.
      * Every provider key ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE is removed for the duration of
        the test (see `_provider_key_envs`). An exported key, or one leaked into
        `os.environ` by an earlier test through `app_keys.write()`, otherwise
        makes later tests take the live provider path.
      * `socket.socket.connect`, `connect_ex`, `sendto` and `sendmsg` are
        refused for any non-loopback peer, FOR CALLS MADE IN THIS PROCESS
        through the Python `socket.socket` class (which `ssl`, `http.client`,
        `urllib`, `asyncio` and `socket.create_connection` all go through).
        With a key loaded, provider code makes live calls, and a test that
        passes when the network is up and fails when it blinks is
        non-deterministic for a reason nobody is looking at.
      * Loopback stays open — TCP and UDP — because the console tests serve
        on it.

    WHAT IS **NOT** COVERED, and both were measured rather than supposed
      * **A SUBPROCESS.** A Python-level patch cannot reach a child process. A
        census of 9,889 children in one full run found four invocations that
        genuinely leave the machine — `gh auth status` and `gh api user`, via
        `github_status()` → `pair._owner()` — from
        test_console_strings_by_execution.py. `git`, `gh` and `codex` are the
        known network-capable children; the 9,385 `git` calls were all local
        (no fetch, push, clone, ls-remote or pull).
      * **THE LOGIN KEYCHAIN.** `security find-generic-password` reads the
        developer's real keychain. This fixture moves the keys FILE; the
        keychain is a different channel and is not moved.
      * **DNS RESOLUTION.** `socket.getaddrinfo` (and `gethostbyname`) is not
        patched: a name lookup leaves the machine, in this process, before any
        socket is connected. `mcp.py` and `broker/tools_research.py` call
        `getaddrinfo`, so this is a product path, not a hypothetical.
      * **THE RAW `_socket.socket`.** The patch is on the Python class
        `socket.socket`; a caller that instantiates the C-level
        `_socket.socket` directly bypasses it (measured: a SYN to TEST-NET
        left the machine).

    Whether the suite should need the network at all is a decision, not a
    defect, and is held separately. This docstring exists so nobody concludes
    it has already been made.

    One correction to this file's own history: an earlier version of this
    docstring called a `RemoteDisconnected` failure "a real socket", which was
    read as evidence of egress. A recorder over `socket.connect` that was never
    torn down logged 290 connects in a full run and **every one was 127.0.0.1**.
    That failure was a local console server closing, not the open network.
