"""The activity stream (docs/design/ACTIVITY_STREAM.md).

Every rendering test here loads the WHOLE shipped `page.py` script under node
and calls the real `renderConversation`. That is not a style choice. The first
version of this file drove sliced-out functions with the rest of the page
stubbed, and an independent review that loaded the script whole found the
owner's original complaints still painted on the screen while all twenty-seven
tests were green: a slice cannot see a second surface rendered further down
`renderConversation`, an action sealed inside a closed `<details>`, or where a
button leads three calls later. So the harness is
`tests/harness/render_page.py`, the stops come from the real
`record_build_escalation` -> `overview.escalations` projection
(`tests/harness/real_stops.py`), and the assertions are made on two
projections of the render:

* `html` — everything rendered.
* `first_paint` — what is on the SCREEN before anyone opens anything. An
  action that appears only in `html` is an action nobody is offered.

Design rules 1 and 8 are driven rather than grepped: every action the render
offers is clicked through the page's own delegated handler, and what became
modal is read off the shipped DOM.
