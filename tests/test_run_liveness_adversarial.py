"""Adversarial run-liveness probes, migrated into the suite as contracts.

Each test here began as a refuter's reproduction of a real hole in the
run-liveness hardening claim. They are kept as formal assertions of the
repaired behavior:

* the cycle ledger's recorded verdicts outrank every supervisor — a watchdog
  or reconciler can never rewrite a PASS into an escalation;
* an auditor-side provider outage parks the run instead of being synthesized
  into a content-flavored verdict and report;
* the lease, not the pid, is the recovery authority (pid reuse cannot mask a
  dead owner forever);
* schema-v1 rows migrate into supervision instead of a silent limbo;
* torn needs-a-human writes heal from either side, at the source first and by
  a bounded reconciliation scan second;
* the parked state has a real command surface, and the CLI status verb shows
  the run journal's truth.
