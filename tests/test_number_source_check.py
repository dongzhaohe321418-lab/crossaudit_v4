"""number → source: the span a generator QUOTES must resolve and contain the number.

`docs/design/PROVENANCE_CHECKS.md` §2.1/§3.1/§3.4 and
`docs/design/PROVENANCE_ADDRESSING.md` §2, on the right side of D155: the
generator names a locator, code opens the file and looks, and nothing anywhere
asks a model what the evidence says.

Since D159 the locator is **content**, not a line number: `src` is
`{"file": …, "quote": …}`, the quote is characters copied from one line of that
file, and there is no cap on its length. The generator is never shown line
numbers, so under the old contract it could not address the lines it was asked
for — Arm 2 blocked 24 of 24 drafts on that alone. A row that still carries the
old `at` field is accepted and its `at` is ignored.

D64 — a guard is specified with the mutation that reddens it, and each docstring
below names its own (`tests/test_repair_guard.py:3-7`). One test is the
exception that proves the rule: `test_the_quote_and_not_the_file_is_what_is_checked`
asserts its mutation goes **green**, because a check that still passed with the
quote widened to the whole file would be checking nothing the design measured.

The fixture is the real shape §4 asks for: a RECIPE.md whose value is on L11, an
explanation.md quoting L11, and the wrong-place case quoting L12 — the line the
value is NOT on, in the file it IS in.

    reddens every assertion below: the file is written, the fence returns to
    the prompt, and every science project is once again handed an addressing
    contract its generator cannot satisfy (Arm 2: 24 of 24 drafts BLOCKED).

    reads the profile — `console/projects.py:1597` and `cli/wizard.py:438` both

    this test green, and the docstring was claiming detection the test did not
    have: AGENTS.md §3.5, a test that overclaims is worse than a missing test.

    The two lists are separate objects coupled only by a comment
    (`scaffold/__init__.py:9-11`, "Kept identical to dcl/profiles.py"), which is
    exactly the drift a guard should catch. So the equality is asserted

    which name that list directly.

    because a skill delivered but never rendered and a skill never written are
    different states and only one of them costs tokens. The gate doing the work

    `10⁵ g` and `5×10³ g` were satisfying an annotation of `10` and `5` with an
    EMPTY unit, because the scanner reads the mantissa and an empty unit asks no
    further question. The rule is: an occurrence whose number continues directly
    into notation this layer does not parse — a superscript exponent, a
    multiplication sign or a caret before a digit — is not a match for any unit,
    the empty one included. The source's number is not the number that was read,
    so no annotation of it can be verified against that line.

    The alternative the review offered — treat an empty unit as a mismatch
    whenever the source has a unit — is rejected, and the reason is measurable
    rather than aesthetic. Under a boundary scanner ANY word after a number is a
    token: `run 5 of 12` would make `of` the unit and `Sample 3 was calcined`
    would make `was` one, so that rule would block every legitimately unitless
    annotation whose number is followed by prose — most of them, on this corpus.

# `benchmarks/expertlongbench/study8/test_arm3_verifiers.py` is the instrument
# these are ported from: the §4 mutation fixtures of
# `docs/design/PROVENANCE_ADDRESSING.md`, written against the harness's own
# `verify_b` before Arm 3 ran. Ported rather than rewritten, and where the
# shipped check disagrees with the harness the difference is named in the test
# that carries it: the cap is gone (D159, below), a quotation is line-scoped
# rather than file-scoped (`test_a_quotation_lies_within_one_line`), and a quote
# the file does not hold is CA-NUM-002 rather than the harness's CA-NUM-001,
# because the quote is the SPAN and a wrong span has always been -002.

#: One long line, SYNTHETIC, with the shape both of Arm 3's false blockers had:
#: a sentence whose value and unit are far enough apart that no quotation of
#: eighty characters contains them both. The archived quotations themselves are
#: corpus text and are not in this repository; see the test below.
