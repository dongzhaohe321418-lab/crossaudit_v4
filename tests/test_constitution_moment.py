"""The constitution is shown and chosen before it is committed (Ledger D6 #4, D8).

The walkthrough typed a plain-prose task and received `# Constitution —
<PROJECT>` with the placeholder unreplaced and 7 BLOCKERs about `metadata.yml`,
`results.json`, quantities and convergence — while the screen one step earlier
promised the rules would be "drafted from this, shown to you, and committed only
if you agree". It was not drafted, not shown, and committed anyway, and the first
real build was then blocked for lacking a file a prose review would never
contain.

Three separate defects wearing one bug number, and they are fixed separately:

* **not shown** — the show-and-agree step existed but ran only on the drafted
  path; the fallback wrote and committed silently. It now runs on every path.
* **wrong shape** — the CLI wrote the laboratory contract and the science check
  pack for any project. `app.py` and `console/projects.py` already chose per
  project type; the CLI was the outlier.
* **`<PROJECT>`** — substituted only by `draft.render()`, never on the template
  path.

Every test executes the real `init` and reads what it printed and wrote
(AGENTS.md §3.5). The last one mutates the product on purpose and demonstrates
the guard fails (Ledger D10).
