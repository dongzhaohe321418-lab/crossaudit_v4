"""Full receipt verification, and the admission transaction.

Verification is read-only and offline: it re-derives every binding from the two
git trees and refuses on the first mismatch. Admission is a separate, explicit
step that consumes the receipt inside the controller's lock.

What `--admit` refuses beyond verification (installer-design 05a):
  * an install mode whose code could have changed since it identified itself;
  * a receipt whose isolation evidence is weaker than the deployment's minimum;
  * a state store inside a throwaway checkout, where "consumed" survives nothing.
