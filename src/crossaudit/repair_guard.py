"""A heuristic screen over automatic Generator repair rounds.

After an audit BLOCKS a round, the generator is asked to repair the cause.
This module reads the repair's staged diff and sorts what it sees into two
kinds of outcome:

**Refusals** (hard, in every mode) are the two things no automatic round may
do because nothing downstream could review them: change a file outside the
audited directories, or commit a binary that CrossAudit's own document
renderer did not produce.  (``generator.apply`` is the first line for the
scope boundary — it denies an out-of-scope write before anything is staged;
this screen is the second, over what actually reached the index.)

**Cautions** are *likely* defensive edits — a catch-all ``except``, an
empty error handler, a suppression marker, a skipped test, a relaxed,
changed or deleted assertion, a branch that never runs, a shell or make step
that ignores its own failure, or a code change larger than the automatic
budget.  Under the default ``repair.mode: caution`` they never stop a round:
they are surfaced to the auditor (as deterministic notes in the next audit's
input, so the auditor model can raise a finding) and shown in the run's
events.  Under ``repair.mode: refuse`` they are refusals.

Every caution sentence is meant to be TRUE as written: a catch-all handler
that re-raises is reported as re-raising, an assertion replaced in the same
hunk is reported as changed, a test re-added under another name as renamed.

What this is not (D10, D146): a guarantee.  It is a handful of regular
expressions over the added and removed lines of code files.  It cannot see
an early ``return {}``, a narrowed ``except`` that ``continue``s, a relaxed
threshold in a data file, ``sys.exit(0)``, an assert moved into an unused
fixture, or a suppression reached through ``getattr``; a docstring or
heredoc whose opening lies outside the hunk is read as code (noise, never a
refusal).  The auditor can see those, and that is why cautions go to the
auditor instead of ending the round.

Three file classes (`classify`):

- **code** — screened for patterns and counted against the line budget;
- **data** (JSON, YAML, TOML, INI, CSV, notebooks) — never pattern-screened,
  never budgeted: a regenerated ``results.json`` is the deliverable, and
  ``retries: 3`` in a config is a value, not a construct;
- **document** (everything else: Markdown, text, TeX, ...) — never
  pattern-screened and never *line*-budgeted.  A report that says "skip the
  introduction" is honest prose (D121).  One line of prose is an unbounded
  amount of prose, so a document has its own budget instead: how much a
  single automatic revision may make it **grow** (`document_growth`).  That
  bound exists because it was measured — on ExpertLongBench T03MaterialSEG
  every automatic revision that grew the deliverable by more than a quarter
  fixed nothing and broke ten rubric items
  (`benchmarks/expertlongbench/RESULTS-4.md`).

Comments, docstrings, doctest lines and string literals are stripped from a
code line before the construct patterns run; the suppression markers, which
live in comments, are matched on the raw line.  Pure: the caller passes the
diff text (``git -c core.quotepath=false diff --cached --binary``) and git's
NUL-separated staged-path list; nothing here calls git.

        ``scope_dirs`` are the audited directories (None: the whole tree).
        ``staged_files`` is git's own NUL-separated list of staged paths; it
        drives the scope screen so a diff cut at the caller's size cap cannot
        hide a file, and with ``truncated=True`` every staged file the diff no
        longer shows is reported as unscreened.  ``locally_rendered_files``
        are the documents CrossAudit itself rendered from the model's source
        — the one kind of binary a round may commit.  ``binary_files`` are
        the paths git itself reports as binary (``parse_numstat``); they are
        refused whether or not the diff text still shows them, so the cap
        limits only the pattern screen, never the binary screen.

        ``document_texts`` maps a document path to ``(before, after)`` — the
        committed bytes the audit judged and the bytes this revision staged in
        their place.  It is what the growth screen reads; a caller that does
        not supply it gets no growth screen, because a unified diff of prose
        cannot tell an added sentence from a re-emitted paragraph.
