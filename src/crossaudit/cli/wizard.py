"""`crossaudit init` — the guided setup, from an empty directory to a first run.

It creates the project if it does not exist, makes it a git repository if it is
not one, settles who audits and who generates, takes the two keys, and turns a
sentence about the project into the rules it will be judged by. Everything is
shown before it is written, and the only thing here that reaches the network is
the one call that drafts the rules.

Interactive when it can be — arrow keys, framed panels — and completely
non-interactive when it cannot: piped stdin and CI take defaults rather than
hanging on a keypress that will never arrive.

Keys go to a 0600 file outside the repository and are never echoed, never put in
`crossaudit.yml`, and never committed.

    Accessibility note: this is a terminal, so there is no aria-live to add. The
    equivalent obligation is that every line reads correctly in linear order and
    that nothing needed to operate the moment is carried only by colour, position
    or box drawing. `tui.select` numbers its options and accepts the number as
    input (Ledger D17), so a screen reader gets the options, their names and
    their consequences as text and can choose without tracking a marker; the
    green `❯` and the bold weight are redundant emphasis on top of that number.
    The chosen option is then said in words when the menu closes rather than
    left implied by a glyph.
