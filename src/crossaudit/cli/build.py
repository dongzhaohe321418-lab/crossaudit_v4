"""`crossaudit build` — the closed loop (DESIGN.md §8, a3).

The user states a task once. The generator writes, the work is committed, the
auditor judges it, and if it was blocked the findings go back to the generator
for another round — until PASS, or until the round budget hands it to a human.

What the user sees is a narration. What the ledger receives is unchanged: every
round is a commit, every verdict a report and a receipt, every escalation a
decision waiting for a person. The box is opaque to interact with and glass on
the inside.

Two things this verb refuses to do, both deliberate:

* **It never lifts a rule to make progress.** A blocked round is returned to the
  generator, never to the rulebook. Loosening a rule is an amendment, which is a
  human's lane and takes effect only between cycles.
* **It stops at the round budget.** Three failed rounds mean the loop cannot
  resolve this itself, which is exactly what I5 is for: escalate rather than
  spin.
