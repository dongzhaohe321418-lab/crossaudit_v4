"""Translation for the CLI, and a fallback nobody can miss.

Why not `gettext`, which is stdlib and would have been the obvious answer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Four reasons, in the order they mattered.

1. **Its fallback is silent by design.** `gettext` returns the msgid when a
   translation is missing, which is exactly right for most software and exactly
   wrong here: a partially translated release would be indistinguishable from a
   finished one, and D21 says a half-Chinese wizard is worse than an English
   one. Making that visible means wrapping `gettext` in the very layer this
   module is, at which point `gettext` is carrying only its file format.
2. **The msgid IS the English string.** Reword an English sentence and every
   translation of it silently orphans — invisible drift of exactly the class
   this team keeps finding. Keys here are stable dotted ids, so English copy can
   be edited freely and only a genuinely NEW string can go missing.
3. **`.mo` files are binaries.** They cannot be read in a diff, and the frozen
   PyInstaller app would need them shipped as data with a `bindtextdomain` path
   that differs between source and bundle. That is a packaging seam bought for
   no benefit.
4. **The console already does it this way.** `page.py` carries a `ZH` mapping.
   One vocabulary across two surfaces beats two mechanisms that drift apart.

`gettext`'s real advantages — plural forms and translator tooling — are the two
we need least: Chinese has no plural agreement, and there is no translator
pipeline to feed. Stdlib only either way; this is not a dependency argument.

Recorded as the implementer's decision, with the reasoning exposed so it is
cheap to overturn: swapping the storage while keeping `t()` is a contained
change, because nothing outside this module knows how the catalogue is stored.

What a missing translation does
-------------------------------
It is served in English, **marked inline** and **counted**. Inline, because that
is what makes it visible in a screenshot, a bug report and a terminal recording
— the places a defect is actually noticed. Counted, because that is what makes
it assertable: `fallbacks()` is what the tests read, and the init path asserts
the count is zero. Neither alone is enough. A counter with no marker is
invisible to a person; a marker with no counter is invisible to CI.

It is deliberately not an exception. Crashing setup over a missing sentence
would turn a copy defect into an outage, and the guard that keeps the catalogue
complete is a test, not a traceback.

What is NOT translated, and why the seam is here
------------------------------------------------
* **Rule ids and check names.** `CA-META-001` is an identifier a person uses to
  trace a verdict back to their own constitution and to a receipt. An id is not
  prose.
* **Exit codes, `--json` payloads, and every machine-readable field.** Those are
  a scripting contract (`errors.py`); a human-readable message is not. That seam
  was drawn once already and this module does not move it.
* **Model-generated text.** A drafted rule's title, a provider's reason, the
  person's own words quoted back to them. We did not write it and must not
  pretend to have translated it.
* **Paths, environment variable names, git output, commands to type.**
