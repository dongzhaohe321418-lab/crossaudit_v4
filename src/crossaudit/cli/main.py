CrossAudit {version} — cross-vendor generation and audit loop

Nothing is configured yet in this directory. One command sets it up; it will
ask for the two models, the two API keys, and your plain-language quality
requirements. It writes keys to a 0600 file outside the repository.

    crossaudit init              guided setup, right here
    crossaudit init --github     the same, plus the two-repository plan

Then, two ways to work:

    crossaudit build "..."       say what you need; CrossAudit writes it, then a
                                 second model from a different vendor checks the
                                 result before you see it
    crossaudit console           the same loop in a browser, live, and it
                                 outlives the window

    crossaudit run               already have a commit? audit that instead

It reads the increment from the commit itself, runs the deterministic checks,
runs the model audit when a key is present, writes the ledger, and tells you
what to do next. The precise tools underneath it, when you want them:

    crossaudit doctor · check · audit · verify · status
