"""Chinese for the refusals: every `Denial` reason, keyed by its English.

Why this is a separate table and not more `t()` keys
----------------------------------------------------
A denial is raised where the refusal is decided — in the audit core, the
providers, the verifier — and those modules must not know which surface will
print them. `errors.py` draws the seam: `reason` is the machine contract (exit
code, `--json`, the line the macOS shell parses), `human` is an optional
sentence for a person. Only three raise sites carry a `human=`; the other
six hundred carry a reason and nothing else, which is why D130 measured the
refusals as the least-translated strings in the product.

So the table is keyed by the English reason **exactly as the source writes
it**, and the lookup is applied to `Denial.reason` only — never to free text.
That keeps D130's rule intact: the identity of the string comes from its
provenance (it was raised as a Denial by us), not from what it happens to look
like, and a person's own words can never be matched against this table.

Two shapes
----------
* A static reason is an exact entry.
* A reason built with an f-string is a **template**: `{}` marks each part the
  source interpolates, in order. The Chinese side keeps the same `{}` slots
  (or `{0}`, `{1}` … to reorder, which Chinese often needs). The interpolated
  parts — paths, ids, shas, counts, another component's own words — are
  carried through untranslated: they are identifiers, not prose, and a
  translation that drops them says less than the English did.

Style
-----
Plain and short. Terminology follows the catalogues that already exist in
`i18n.CATALOGUE["zh"]` and the console's `ZH` map: 生成者 / 审计者, 收据,
判定, 账本, 准入, 章程, 周期, 轮, 供应商 / 厂商, 凭据, 备用路由, 工作区,
钥匙串, 工作仓库 / 审计仓库, 指导, 技能, 检查. Identifiers, config keys,
flags, commands, verdict words (PASS, BLOCKED) and file names stay Latin.

The table is data; the lookup lives in `i18n.denial_zh()`. The gate in
`tests/test_denial_strings_are_legible.py` pins the residual (the reasons
deliberately left without an entry) and refuses every entry whose English is
raised nowhere, so the table cannot rot in either direction.
"""
from __future__ import annotations

#: (english reason or template, chinese). ORDER MATTERS within templates only
#: where one template could match another's rendering: the more specific one
#: goes first. Every entry is anchored to the whole reason, so a shorter
#: template never swallows a longer sentence that merely starts the same way.
