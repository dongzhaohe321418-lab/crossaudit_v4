"""One audit cycle: DCL, model audit, verdict synthesis, report, receipt.

Verdict synthesis is code, never model output (I4), and every path that is not
a clean, valid, model-backed PASS lands somewhere other than PASS (I8):

    escalation lock            -> ESCALATE   (an escalated cycle is not routed around)
    DCL hard failure           -> BLOCKED    (dominates any model opinion)
    invalid or failed audit    -> ESCALATE
    prompt bound exceeded      -> ESCALATE   (the model did not see everything)
    unstarted scope            -> ESCALATE   (NOTHING_AUDITED: an empty scope is not clean)
    no model ran               -> DCL_ONLY   (never a conforming PASS)
    otherwise                  -> the model's own verdict
    lone model BLOCKER         -> BLOCKED by default (bounded revision, recorded as
                                  unverified); ESCALATE under
                                  authority.lone_model_blocker: escalate

The evidence-authority layer (authority.py) runs AFTER the ladder and derives
from its result; it changes the verdict only under that opt-in dial.
