"""Named check profiles — strictness as a legible dial, not a flat name list.

CrossAudit's identity (independent cross-vendor audit, evidence ledger, signed
receipts, per-call human approval) is always on and domain-agnostic. The
deterministic checks are an OPTIONAL rigor layer on top, and `checks:` in
``crossaudit.yml`` selects how much of it runs. Rather than hand-listing opaque
check names, a project can name a profile:

    off      core audit chain only (no deterministic checks)
    general  the domain-neutral pack — the light default: parses, dangling
             declarations, broken links (advisory), leftover placeholders
             (advisory). Binds no data format; fits code, docs, web, contracts.
    science  structured-science rigor: schema, units, convergence, declared
             inputs that exist, provenance, and declared number sources.

An explicit list is still accepted verbatim, so a project can compose its own mix
(e.g. the general pack plus ``complete-strict`` to make placeholders hard-fail).
