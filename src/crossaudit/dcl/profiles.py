"""Named check profiles — strictness as a legible dial, not a flat name list.

CrossAudit's identity (independent cross-vendor audit, evidence ledger, signed
receipts, per-call human approval) is always on and domain-agnostic. The
deterministic checks are an OPTIONAL rigor layer on top, and `checks:` in
``crossaudit.yml`` selects how much of it runs. Rather than hand-listing opaque
check names, a project can name a profile:

    off      core audit chain only (no deterministic checks)
    general  the domain-neutral pack — the light default: parses, dangling
             declarations, broken links (advisory), leftover placeholders
             (advisory). Binds no data format; fits code, docs, web, contracts.
    science  structured-science rigor: schema, units, convergence, provenance
             (inputs that exist and are cited exactly).

An explicit list is still accepted verbatim, so a project can compose its own mix
(e.g. the general pack plus ``complete-strict`` to make placeholders hard-fail).

    # §1's gap — a quantity citing an input that is listed and does not exist —
    # is closed INSIDE `check_provenance`, not by adding the neutral pack's
    # `declared` here. `declared` reads every YAML's `sources`, `requires` and
    # `depends_on` as filenames as well, so bringing it into science blocked
    # legitimate metadata (`sources: [doi:10.1234/x]`); the profile stays as it
    # was and the check got stronger, which is the direction that is allowed.

    # `number_source` is here since D164 ruling 1 (2026-09-07). Its history is
    # the reason the list is guarded by name: D157 put it in both profiles;
    # Arm 2 (`benchmarks/expertlongbench/RESULTS-ARM2.md`) ran it against what
    # a real generator writes and **no annotation row of 215 passed, 24 of 24
    # drafts BLOCKED**, because the generator is never shown line numbers and
    # could not address the lines the contract asked for; D158 took it out the
    # same day. Content addressing replaced line numbers (D159), a frozen gold
    # licensed five containment extensions measured at W = 0 each (D160,
    # slices 4–8), and Arm 5 (`RESULTS-ARM5.md`) then measured the shipped
    # check on every T03 instance at **4 of 398 correct annotations blocked**
    # (Wilson 0.39–2.56%) — the preregistered §8g PASS band. It sits LAST so
    # that a project's `checks:` reads as the pack plus the annotation check
    # it depends on; `scaffold.SCIENCE_CHECKS` carries the same list, so a
    # science project gets the check, the skill that asks the generator for
    # the annotation, and the blocker together (the design's §6.4 failure — a
    # check on without the skill — is what the two lists moving together
    # prevents). `general` and `research` are untouched; the check remains
