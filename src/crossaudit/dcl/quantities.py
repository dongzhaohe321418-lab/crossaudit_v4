"""What a quantity is, and what makes two numbers the same number.

Shared by `builtin.check_provenance` and `numbers.check_number_source` because
they must agree, and the way they stopped agreeing is instructive. The span
widening let `check_provenance` accept `path@revision#L14` on the promise that
`number_source` would open the file and look — but `number_source` recognised
only the exact basename `results.json` where builtin recognised any path ending
in it, and it skipped rows whose `value` was a shape it could not read, on the
belief that `check_units` validated `value`. `check_units` tests the truthiness
of `unit` and `source` and has never looked at `value` at all. Between the two
gaps, a quantity with a null value citing line 999 of a two-line file passed the
complete science profile with no finding, where the code before the widening
blocked it.

So the three things both checks need — which files hold quantities, what the
declared inputs are, and whether a value is a number — live here, once.

**Numbers are compared as canonical decimal strings, never as floats.** Two
integers 2**53 apart round to the same double, so a float comparison would
report a span containing 9007199254740992 as containing 9007199254740993: a
check saying it verified a number literally while accepting a different one.
`Decimal` construction from a string is exact and unbounded, and `format(d, "f")`
is exact, so `1e3` and `1000` canonicalise to the same string without either
one passing through binary floating point.

#: 100 false passes out of 100. Here the pattern is used with `fullmatch`, so an
