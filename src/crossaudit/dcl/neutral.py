"""Domain-neutral checks: what can be verified mechanically about any work.

The v1 pack assumed experiment data — units, convergence, provenance. Those are
excellent checks and wrong to demand of a contract review or a web app. This
pack asks only what holds for any project whose output is files:

    declared     every file the work declares as an input exists
    parseable    files whose extension promises a format actually parse as it
    internal     internal links and references point at something that exists
    complete     no placeholder left where content was promised

None of these needs a model, and each one catches a class of defect that models
are unreliable at noticing precisely because it is boring: a broken link, a stray
TODO, a JSON file that stopped being JSON.

The default draws an honest line by severity: structural integrity is a blocker
(`parseable`, `declared` — a file that does not parse or a declaration pointing
at nothing), while quality reminders are advisory (`internal` broken links,
`complete` leftover placeholders) — visible, but they do not fail an otherwise
sound increment, so the light default suits everyday and work-in-progress use. A
project that wants placeholders to hard-fail adds the `complete-strict` check.

Where a domain pack exists, it adds to this. Where none does, this is what
stands between the model audit and nothing — and the honest consequence, stated
in DESIGN.md §5, is that I4's mechanical guarantee is thinner, not absent.
