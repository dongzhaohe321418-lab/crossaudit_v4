"""Check registry and runner.

A check is a callable taking the materialised increment (path -> bytes) and
returning findings. Builtins are registered by name; third-party packs arrive
through the `crossaudit.checks` entry-point group in 0.4 and are, by design,
not discovered automatically — an entry point is arbitrary code execution, so
loading is allowlist-only (installer-design 05a).
