#: Turning such a check on with nothing telling the generator to annotate gives
#: a check that passes every document while appearing to guard it — a name that
#: lies (PROVENANCE_CHECKS.md §5.4). So the skill ships beside the check, on the
#: shipped channel and no other: a committed `skills/*.md`, loaded by
#: `skills.load`, rendered into the generator prompt by `skills.render`, hashed
#: into the receipt, and never shown to the auditor.
#: One FILE per check, not one file per project. A single composed file could
#: only be gated as a whole, and its composition is fixed at scaffold time —
#: turn `number_source` off a month later and the number-annotation contract
#: keeps arriving in every generator prompt, describing a fence nothing will
#: ever read. Each file carries `requires_check:` in its front matter and
#: `skills.select` reads it against the project's live `checks:` on every round.
