# Constitution — <PROJECT>

Version this file in git. Every audit cites the commit that carried it. Rule
changes take effect only between cycles, so work is never judged against a
target that moved underneath it.

Each rule has a stable ID and a decidable criterion. **BLOCKER** gates the
increment when an objective requirement is not met. **ADVISORY** records
judgement or an improvement opportunity and never gates admission.

### CA-TASK-001
**BLOCKER.** When a committed `TASK.md` exists, the delivered work satisfies
every objectively testable requirement it states, including requested scope,
length, format, and number of deliverables. Substituting an unrequested format
or creating extra deliverables that obscure the requested result is a defect.
A length stated as exact must match exactly. A length stated approximately is
a guide, not a threshold: note it as ADVISORY only if the work departs from it
by more than a quarter of the stated length, and it is not a BLOCKER on its
own; a departure so large that the deliverable is a different thing (a fraction
or a multiple of what was asked) is materially noncompliant and blocks.

### CA-CONTENT-001
**BLOCKER.** The primary deliverable is complete, internally consistent, and
contains no unresolved placeholder such as TODO, TBD, or sample text.

### CA-CONTENT-002
**BLOCKER.** Claims presented as facts do not contradict the supplied source
material or other files in the audited increment.

### CA-USABILITY-001
**ADVISORY.** The deliverable should be easy for its intended reader to locate,
open, and use without needing unrelated supporting files.

<!-- Add project-specific rules below. Keep the ID scheme CA-<AREA>-<NNN>, one
     heading per rule, severity in the first line, and a decidable criterion.

     A rule is read by the auditor. It is ALSO shown to the writer only if it
     carries a `<!-- brief -->` line, which marks it as describing the SHAPE of
     the deliverable — format, structure, length, which files exist. Leave the
     marker off a rule that GRADES finished work: a writer shown a grading
     checklist writes to the checklist instead of to the task. CA-TASK-001 is in
     the brief without a marker, because it is what the deliverable must be. -->
